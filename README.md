# Neural Networks and Autoencoders in Python

*Advanced undergraduate machine learning coursework project (University College Dublin)*

## Overview
This repository contains a set of neural network implementations developed as part of advanced undergraduate coursework in the Maths of Machine Learning module. The project focuses on understanding the foundations of neural networks through both conceptual analysis and practical implementation, with particular emphasis on autoencoders, representation learning, and supervised regression models.

The work combines theoretical reasoning with hands-on experimentation using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, exploring how network architecture, activation functions, and training choices affect model performance and generalisation.

## What I did
- Implemented and trained an autoencoder to learn low-dimensional representations of structured input data.
- Analysed the encoder–decoder structure and interpreted the learned latent space.
- Developed feedforward neural networks for regression tasks using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Compared model behaviour under different architectural and training choices.
- Investigated convergence, generalisation, and sources of model error.
- Visualised training dynamics, reconstructions, predictions, and residuals.
- Structured the work in a clear, reproducible Jupyter notebook with explanatory Markdown.

## Technical focus
- **Programming:** Python, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Machine learning:** neural networks, autoencoders, representation learning
- **Concepts:** optimisation, loss functions, overfitting, generalisation, model evaluation

## Notes
This repository serves as a portfolio example demonstrating foundational machine learning understanding and clean experimental workflows, rather than production-optimised models.

The work reflects an emphasis on conceptual clarity, interpretability, and correct implementation of core neural network ideas.
